"""Week 5 · Task 1 — PageRank, and the two ways it breaks.

Textbook §5.1 (PageRank), §5.1.3 (dead ends), §5.1.4 (spider traps).

PageRank is a random surfer following links forever, and the rank of a page is
how often the surfer is there. As one line of linear algebra it is
`r = M r`, and as written it does not work on the actual web.

Two structures break it, and the fix for both is the same one line. Build the
broken version first so you can see each failure, then fix it.

    """Rank every node. Return {node: rank}, summing to 1.

    `beta` is the probability the surfer follows a link. With probability
    1 - beta they teleport to a node chosen uniformly.

    You have to handle both of these, and the textbook handles them the same way:

      dead ends    a node with no out-links. Where does its rank go, and where
                   should it go instead?
      spider traps a group of nodes that only link to each other. Without
                   teleporting, they end up with all of it

    Stop early when the ranks stop moving - `tol` is the L1 change below which
    you should call it converged. Return the ranks, and set `pagerank.iterations`
    to how many you actually used, because Task 2 measures that.

    ---------------------------------------------------------------- choices

    Dead ends: a dead end's rank is spread **uniformly over every node**, as if
    it linked to all of them (§5.1.3's "treat it as linking everywhere"). The
    alternative the book gives - deleting dead ends recursively and ranking them
    afterwards - changes the graph being ranked. Spreading keeps the graph and
    conserves total rank exactly, and it is what Task 3's dense baseline does,
    so both tasks answer the same question.

    Spider traps: with probability 1 - beta the surfer teleports to a uniformly
    chosen node, so a trap can hold at most what flows into it - it cannot
    keep all of it.

    `pagerank.converged` is set as well: when `iterations` runs out before the
    change drops below `tol`, the answer is not converged and Task 2 should say
    so rather than report a capped count as if it were a real one.
